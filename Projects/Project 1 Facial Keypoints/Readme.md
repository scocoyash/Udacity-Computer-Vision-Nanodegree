### Project Overview

----

We build a facial keypoint detection system that takes in any image with faces, and predicts the location of 68 distinguishing keypoints on each face!

Facial keypoints include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on a face and are used in many applications. These applications include: facial tracking, facial pose recognition, facial filters, and emotion recognition. 

Completed code in this repo looks at any image, detect faces, and predict the locations of facial keypoints on each face.

Also, the Paper's folder contains papers read during the implementation of the project. 
Hope you read it too for better understanding of the subject.
